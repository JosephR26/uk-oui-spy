   - Check Siemens (smart city)

3. **Residential Test**
   - Walk through neighborhood
   - Expect many TP-Link, Xiaomi, Ring, Nest
   - Consumer brands should dominate

4. **Police Test**
   - If you see police officers
   - Axon body cameras should detect quickly
   - RSSI should be very high (close proximity)

5. **Motorway Test**
   - Drive on major road/motorway
   - Look for 360 Vision, Jenoptik
   - ANPR/speed cameras
