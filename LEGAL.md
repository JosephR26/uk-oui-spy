## Privacy Notice

The UK-OUI-SPY PRO device itself is designed with user privacy as a priority. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information of the user.

*   **Data Storage**: All detection data is stored locally on the user-provided microSD card. The developers have no access to this data.
*   **Encrypted Logging**: The device offers an optional AES-128 encryption feature for logs stored on the SD card. It is the user's responsibility to enable this feature and manage their encryption keys securely.
*   **Web Portal**: The embedded web portal operates on a closed, local Wi-Fi network created by the device. It does not connect to the internet. All communication between the device and the web browser is confined to this local network.
*   **Cloud Sync**: The optional Cloud Sync feature is disabled by default. If the user chooses to enable it, they are responsible for configuring a secure endpoint and understanding the privacy implications of transmitting detection data to a third-party server.
