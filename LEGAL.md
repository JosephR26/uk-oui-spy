# Legal Information

## Legal Disclaimer

The UK-OUI-SPY PRO is a tool intended for educational, research, and professional security auditing purposes. It is designed to promote privacy awareness by identifying the presence of potential surveillance devices in a given area.

The device operates by passively receiving and analysing publicly broadcast radio signal metadata (Wi-Fi and Bluetooth MAC addresses, signal strength, and channel information). It does not intercept, record, decrypt, or store the content of any communications. The information it gathers is limited to manufacturer identifiers (OUIs), signal strength, and other metadata. Passive reception of broadcast metadata is not prohibited under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006, provided no private communications content is intercepted or disclosed (Section 48).

Users of this device are solely responsible for its use in compliance with all applicable local, national, and international laws. This includes, but is not limited to, laws concerning privacy, electronic surveillance, and data protection (such as the GDPR and the UK Data Protection Act 2018).

The developers, manufacturers, and distributors of the UK-OUI-SPY PRO shall not be held liable for any illegal or unauthorized use of this product. Misuse of this device for activities such as stalking, harassment, corporate espionage, or any other violation of privacy is strictly prohibited and is the sole responsibility of the user.

## Privacy Notice

The UK-OUI-SPY PRO device itself is designed with user privacy as a priority. It does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information of the user.

*   **Data Storage**: All detection data is stored locally on the user-provided microSD card. The developers have no access to this data.
*   **Encrypted Logging**: The device offers an optional AES-128 encryption feature for logs stored on the SD card. It is the user's responsibility to enable this feature and manage their encryption keys securely.
*   **Web Portal**: The embedded web portal operates on a closed, local Wi-Fi network created by the device. It does not connect to the internet. All communication between the device and the web browser is confined to this local network.
*   **No Cloud Connectivity**: The device does not connect to the internet and does not transmit detection data to any external server. All data remains on the local SD card and local Wi-Fi portal.
